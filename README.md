# Pareto Selection Tool - A Part of Data Audit Tool

This is a part of AHRI Analytical Data Audit Tool (a.k.a. selection tool) with a limited focus on Pareto Boundary Search.

## Installation

Use your R-Studio version of choice and download all required libraries. NOTE: it may be bit tedious to initially setup because vanilla R often does not have a production grade package manager.

## Where to use?

If you have a data having several tiered grouping variables and want to make selection based on your preferences this app comes handy.
